  paragraphOne: `\t My journey to software development started after college. I became a math teacher then entered the seminary.

  paragraphTwo: `\t So with my friendâ€™s inspiration I started digging deeper into the work of software engineering and the more I learned the more fun it became. I enjoy talking to other people about projects and new technologies, and I thrive on developing creative solutions with the people I work with.`,
